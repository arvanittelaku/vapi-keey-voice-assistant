QUESTIONS ABOUT PRICING:

"Is your fee negotiable?"
For multiple properties or special circumstances, yes. Let's discuss your specific situation.

"What if bookings are slow?"
Our fee is percentage-based, so we only earn when you earn. We're incentivized to maximize your bookings.

"Can I see a detailed cost breakdown?"
Absolutely! We provide complete transparency with detailed monthly statements.

"Do I pay you directly?"
No, we automatically deduct our fee from rental income and transfer the rest to you.

"What about taxes?"
You're responsible for tax reporting on rental income. We provide detailed statements to help with tax filing.

"Can I choose which services I want?"
Our standard package is all-inclusive, but we can discuss custom packages for unique needs.

Bottom Line:
Our pricing is fair, transparent, and designed to maximize your return. Most owners see 20-40% higher net income with us than managing themselves, while saving 15-20 hours per month and eliminating all stress.

It's not just about the fee percentage—it's about the total value delivered.
