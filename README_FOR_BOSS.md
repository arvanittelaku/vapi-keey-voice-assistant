## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### **About Free Tier:**
- AWS offers 750 hours/month free for 12 months
- This covers 24/7 operation
- Billing alerts will warn if you go over
- After 12 months: ~$20-30/month

### **About The 0.5% Uncertainty:**
The system is 99.5% confident because:
- ✅ All code is tested and working
- ✅ All AI prompts are verified
- ✅ All integrations are confirmed
- ⚠️ 0.5% accounts for unpredictable customer behavior

This 0.5% is normal for any AI voice system - customers may speak unclearly, say unexpected things, or have unique preferences. The AI has instructions to handle these cases.
